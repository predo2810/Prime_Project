# Prime Project
 A project for calculating prime numbers.

I came up with this idea while at school with my friend, trying to find the prime number calculus. After many tries, we reached only 7 numbers...
So, i asked myself, *why not let the computer do the whole process?*

And here it is, the prime calculator program, using prime verifying and a formula input, you can try to reach the ***"master prime"***.

This project is under development and you **will** encounter many, many, many issues. So, let me know if you get some.
